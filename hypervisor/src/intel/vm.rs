//! Manages the VMCS region for VMX operations within a virtualized environment.

//! Offers functionality to configure and activate the VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure),
//! which is essential for executing and managing VMX operations on Intel CPUs. This includes
//! setting up guest and host states, managing memory with EPT (Extended Page Tables), and
//! handling VM-exit reasons for debugging and control purposes.
